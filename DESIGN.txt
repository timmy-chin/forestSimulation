These methods could have went to either Entity or WorldModel:
+createHouse(): Entity        <<static>>
+createObstacle(): Entity    <<static>>
+createTree(): Entity    <<static>>
+createStump(): Entity   <<static>>
+createSapling(): Entity   <<static>>
+createFairy(): Entity     <<static>>
+createDudeNotFull(): Entity     <<static>>
+createDudeFull(): Entity       <<static>>
I chose to put them into the Entity class because they are used most in Entity
and the methods returns an entity.

adjacent() could have went to either Entity or Point
I chose to put it in Point because it does calculations with points

nearestEntity() could have went to either WorldModel or Point
I chose to put it i n Point beacuse it does calculations with points

processImageLine()
getImages()
setAlpha()
could have stayed in Functions
I chose to put them in ImageStore because they are only used in that class
and they are operating on images
